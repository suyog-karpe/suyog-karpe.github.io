## Projects
### ConnectCraft - Simplifying Network Choices 
[Publication](https://www.ijariit.com/manuscript/connectcraft-simplifying-network-choices/)

- Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
- Engineered feature extraction system processing 1M+ geolocation data points using Java, integrating temporal and spatial patterns for network analysis.
- Automated data collection with Firebase, processing 100GB+ of network data, and built ensemble models reducing false predictions by 35%.

### ETL using AWS-RDS Dream11
[Code](https://github.com/suyog-karpe/ETL-using-AWS-RDS-Dream11)

- Developed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline to process historical IPL match data, creating a Dream11 points system for players.
- Utilized AWS RDS for database management, Python for data processing, and SQL for querying.

### NLP web app
[Code](https://github.com/suyog-karpe/nlp-web-app)

- Developed a web application utilizing NLP techniques to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, text summarization, and keyword extraction.
- Built the app using Flask for backend functionality, integrated NLP libraries (NLTK, SpaCy) for text processing, and designed a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
